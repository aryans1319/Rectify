## Rectify - Automated Exam Proctoring tool for Online Exams using Face Recognition
### üö© Overview 
During COVID 19 pandemic, online education has become a common norm in schools and colleges, and students themselves are adapted to this online environment of education, as classes are being held in online mode, exams are also conducted online and students tend to cheat in those exams due to lack of security and no physical guarding by professors/teachers, so here is my solution to the problem!

**Rectify** - An automated online proctoring tool that uses **facial recognition** to detect activities of examinees live during the exam and report live analysis to the professor

## üö© Features of Live Face Recognition Model:
Feature | Images
------------ | -------------
**Face Visibility** If you try to hide your face from webcam or moveout of the frame it gives a warning after few seconds,that your face is not visible! | ![facenot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72180855/169716958-4f6a6cdc-9b60-48a4-9acc-a2833a084cbe.jpg)
**Multiple Face Recognition** If more than one face is detected during the exam, the model detects it and action is reported to the professor. |![multiple face detection](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72180855/169717137-38d3ee73-56f0-46cb-87d3-a15e201932ab.jpg)
**Cell Phone Detection** If any student tries to cheat via phone the model detects it and immediately reports it to the professor then and there | ![cell phone detection](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72180855/169334442-3d799e4e-4536-447f-b9c3-4484af2fe74a.jpg) 
**Disabled Copy/Paste** If any student tries to copy any questions to search on the web it immediately detects and report it to the professor as control keys are disable | ![ctrlkey](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72180855/169334801-55e0f168-f7c6-4742-a3e2-812376a6a871.jpg)
**Disabled Tab Change** Tab changing is strictly monitored during the live examination, if any student tries to open any other tab, the model detects and reports it immediately to the professor that student is changing the tab as well as the number of times he changed | ![tabchange](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72180855/169334996-10b8debe-92a9-4472-adbc-fc20ff78cf81.jpg)
**Prohibited Object Detection!** Some prohibited objects such as books,any other laptop is also detected if any student tries to choose this way of malpractice | ![booldetect](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72180855/169391280-b536cf0a-37cc-4203-8ffc-d477f9a373e1.jpg)

**Other Features :**
1. Dynamic Teacher's Dashboard 
2. Sorting and searching functionalites in Professor's Dashboard
3. Return Back to exam within set time (done because if any student losses connection during the exam) he can return back to it.
4. Exam creation dialog box which automatically copies generated exam code to clipboard

**Note:** - Since in the current iteration of the project I am using google form link from professor instead of making questions in the application itself, it is impossible to put key listeners and right click prevention in it since its a third party app and React prevents it due to security reasons. To test these features, please do ctrl press, alt press and right click on left side of screen only.

## üö© Future Scopes:-

Feature | Explanation
------------ | -------------
Creating Exam Feature in the application itself| Instead of using a external link(google/microsoft forms),exam creation in the web-application itself would provide more security and better user experience to the product.
Class Management | All class management activities (branch/section wise) separately for every year students, creating assignment in the application itself assigning tasks and keep a record of every student activites individually in different sections.
Video Calling support | Video calling support between students and teacher for quick doubt resolve and better teacher to student interaction
